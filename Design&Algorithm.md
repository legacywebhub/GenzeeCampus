# Monetizing non academic tasks

Monetizing non-academic tasks that are carried out outside the platform can indeed present a challenge. However, there are several strategies you can consider to monetize such tasks indirectly or facilitate transactions within your platform:

Service Fees: You can charge a service fee for facilitating the connection between users who post non-academic tasks and those who offer to complete them. Users can negotiate terms and details within the platform, and upon successful completion, you can charge a percentage-based service fee.

Premium Features: Introduce premium features or subscription plans for users who engage in non-academic task transactions. Premium users may have access to additional functionalities, such as priority listing for task postings or enhanced communication tools.

Advertisement Revenue: Explore opportunities for advertising partnerships or sponsored content related to non-academic tasks. You can display targeted advertisements or sponsored listings relevant to the interests and preferences of your user base.

Affiliate Programs: Partner with relevant service providers or vendors who offer products or services related to non-academic tasks. You can earn referral commissions by promoting their offerings to your user base and facilitating transactions through affiliate links or codes.

Escrow Services: Offer optional escrow services for non-academic task transactions conducted outside the platform. Users may opt to use your escrow service for added security and peace of mind, for which you can charge a fee.

Value-added Services: Provide value-added services such as task verification, dispute resolution, or quality assurance for non-academic tasks. Users may be willing to pay for these additional services to streamline their transactions and mitigate risks.

Membership Programs: Introduce membership programs or loyalty rewards for users who frequently engage in non-academic tasks on your platform. Members may enjoy exclusive benefits, discounts, or rewards based on their level of engagement.

By implementing a combination of these monetization strategies, you can generate revenue from non-academic tasks while enhancing the overall user experience and value proposition of your platform. It's essential to strike a balance between monetization and user satisfaction to foster long-term growth and sustainability.

## Task Application

To implement task applications or proposals, where multiple users can apply for a task and the task owner can select one applicant (with the option to reassign if necessary), a pivot table is indeed a suitable approach. This setup allows you to keep track of all applications and manage assignments effectively.

Steps to Implement Task Applications:
Create a pivot table to track applications/proposals.
Store the assignment status in the pivot table.
Allow reassignment of tasks by updating the pivot table.
Database Structure:
Tasks Table
Users Table
Applications Table (pivot table)

Example Workflow:
User Applies for a Task:

A record is created in the applications table with the status applied.
Task Owner Reviews Applications:

The task owner can view all applications related to their task.
They select one user and update the applications table, setting the status to assigned.
Task Reassignment:

If the task needs to be reassigned, the task owner can update the relevant records in the applications table:
Set the status of the currently assigned user to reassigned.
Set the status of the new user to assigned.
Completion:

Once the task is completed, update the status to completed in both the tasks table and the relevant applications record.
